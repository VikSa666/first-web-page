# My first web page

This project consists on a simple web page in `html`, `css` and `javascript` and it is a project provided by [Duke Learn to Program](www.dukelearntoprogram.com) in a course provided by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web).

## Structure of the repository
The repository is as simply as it only contains one `html` file, one `css` file and one `javascript` file. It is only to learn how to use these three languages to create a website, and also to learn how to do it from **Visual Studio Code** rather than a given environtment that makes things easier. 

## Contents of the website
The website created here is just a simple one-page website that contains some options related to picture filters and picture uploading, etc. As I said a hundred times, it is only for learning purposes and it is the very first website I create using this three languages, so it may contain absurde things and it is also not very beautiful. The actions that can be done here are:
1. Upload an image from your computer.
2. Create filters, such as *grayscale* or *blur* and also color filters.
3. Change the brightness and contrast (althoug these two do not work very well) of the image
4. Clear canvases and reset the image to the original
